AutoSchedU â€“ Automated Course Scheduling System
AutoSchedU is a Django-based academic course scheduling system designed for university-level use. It automates the creation of weekly course timetables, optimizes room usage, prevents conflicts, and simplifies student and instructor enrollment workflows. The project includes an Excel-based batch enrollment system and an intelligent scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns courses based on availability and constraints.

ðŸ”§ Core Features
Automatic Course Scheduling Algorithm

Assigns courses to available time slots without overlapping instructors or students

Takes classroom availability, course types (theory/lab), and capacity constraints into account

Supports fixed day/hour enforcement for certain courses if needed

Excel-Based Student Course Enrollment

Upload Excel files to batch assign students to courses

Automatically creates new student/instructor accounts if not found in the system

Supports multi-department course enrollments

Role-Based User System

Coordinator: Generates timetables, manages departments, and performs admin tasks

Instructor: Views assigned courses and schedules

Student: Views personal schedule and registered courses

Manual Adjustments via Admin Panel

Timetables can be edited manually after automatic generation

Schedule is shown in visual grid format (similar to a classic weekly calendar)

ðŸ§  Scheduling Logic Overview
The scheduling algorithm works by:

Analyzing All Constraints

Instructor availability (unavailable days/hours)

Room types and capacities

Course hour requirements (e.g., 2-hour per week)

Avoiding overlaps between departments and shared courses

Greedy + Backtracking Assignment

Greedy logic tries best-fit placements

If unsatisfiable, the algorithm backtracks and tries alternatives

Ensures balanced distribution of courses across the week

Final Output

Saves the generated timetable to the database

Displays it in a table for each class and department

Excel export available
